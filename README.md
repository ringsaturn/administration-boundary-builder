# Administration Boundary Builder

Welcome to the Administration Boundary Builder project. At present, this project
does not distribute any actual datasets. Instead, it focuses on providing codes
and tools to construct boundary files utilizing a variety of open data sources.

remains open and accessible to the community while maintaining the necessary

It is important for all users and contributors to understand the complexities
and sensitivities surrounding global administrative boundaries. To address this,
we have prepared a detailed `DISCLAIMER`, which can be found in the
[DISCLAIMER](./DISCLAMIER) file. We strongly encourage all users and
contributors to read this disclaimer thoroughly to understand the nuances of
